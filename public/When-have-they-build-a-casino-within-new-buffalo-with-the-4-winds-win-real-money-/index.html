The casino is a joint venture between the Native American tribes of the Seneca Nation of New York and the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians, and it will be operated by the 4 Winds Casinos. The new Buffalo casino will include a 136,000-square-foot gaming floor with 1,600 slot machines and 50 table games, as well as a 12-story hotel with 250 rooms, a spa, and three restaurants. It is scheduled to open in 2019.</p>
<h1 id="4-Winds-Casino-to-Build-in-New-Buffalo"><a href="#4-Winds-Casino-to-Build-in-New-Buffalo" class="headerlink" title="4 Winds Casino to Build in New Buffalo"></a>4 Winds Casino to Build in New Buffalo</h1><p>The 4 Winds Casino Resort in New Buffalo, Michigan is set to break ground on a new expansion project. The $4 million project, expected to be complete by the end of the year, will add a new hotel wing and more gaming space to the popular casino resort.</p>
<p>The 4 Winds Casino Resort opened in December 2013 and has been a huge success. The new expansion project is a response to customer demand, as the casino has regularly been at capacity since it opened. The new hotel wing will have 50 rooms, bringing the total number of rooms at 4 Winds to 275.</p>
<p>The new gaming space will include 10 table games and 100 new slot machines. This will bring the total number of gaming positions at 4 Winds to 505. The expansion project is also expected to create 30 new jobs.</p>
<p>“This project is all about creating a better experience for our guests,” said Randy Dreiling, Chairman of the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians which owns 4 Winds Casino Resort. “We continue to see incredible demand for our property and this expansion ensures that we can accommodate that demand.” </p>
<p>4 Winds Casino Resort is one of the most popular casinos in Michigan, with over 2,500 slots and 60 table games. It is also one of the largest tribally owned casinos in the country.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the Seneca Nation of Indians announced they were in the preliminary stages of planning a new casino in Buffalo. The proposed site is just east of the Peace Bridge and close to the Canadian border.</p>
<p>Now, according to a recent report from WBFO, 4 Winds has purchased the property and plans to break ground on the new casino later this year. 4 Winds currently operates three casinos in New York – in Niagara Falls, Salamanca, and Evans Mills.</p>
<p>The new Buffalo casino is expected to create 1,000 jobs and generate $200 million for the local economy each year. It will also feature a hotel, restaurants, and a spa.</p>
<p>Despite the news, there is still some opposition to the project. Some residents are concerned about increased traffic and crime in the area. Others worry that the new casino will siphon business away from other local casinos, like those run by Seneca Nation.</p>
<p>But proponents argue that the new casino will bring much-needed economic development to Buffalo and create jobs for local residents. And with 4 Winds already operating successful casinos in New York State, it’s likely that their Buffalo casino will be a success as well.</p>

The casino will be located on a 60-acre parcel of land at the intersection of Harlem Road and Erie County’s Wendel Road, adjacent to the Buffalo Niagara International Airport.</p>
<p>The project is expected to create 1,500 jobs and support more than 4,000 jobs in the region. The resort will feature a 125,000-square-foot casino floor with 2,500 slot machines and 75 table games; a 12-story hotel with 300 rooms; a spa and salon; five restaurants; and a multi-purpose event center.</p>
<p>The casino is scheduled to open in the spring of 2021. 4 Winds Win has already entered into an agreement with the Seneca Gaming Corporation to provide gaming services for the new resort.</p>

The project is expected to create 1,500 jobs and attract 1.5 million visitors a year.</p>
<p>The new resort will feature a 150,000-square-foot gaming floor with 2,500 slots and video poker machines, 100 table games, and a 15-story hotel with 300 rooms. There will also be a spa, pool, fitness center, and several restaurants.</p>
<p>4 Winds is the second casino to open in Buffalo since voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2013 allowing Las Vegas-style casinos in New York. The Seneca Nation’s $330 million Niagara Falls casino opened last year.</p>
<p>The new 4 Winds casino could spark some competition among the tribes with already existing casinos in western New York. The Oneida Nation’s Turning Stone Resort Casino is the state’s largest Indian casino with more than 35,000 slot machines and 400 table games. The tribe has been pushing for an expansion that would include a new hotel tower, golf course, and spa.</p>
<p>Casino gambling has been a major revenue generator for Indian tribes across the country. The National Indian Gaming Commission reported that tribal casinos took in $31.2 billion in gaming revenues in 2016, up 3 percent from the previous year.</p>
