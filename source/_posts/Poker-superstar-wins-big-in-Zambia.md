#  Poker superstar wins big in Zambia

Poker superstar Phil Ivey jetted into Lusaka yesterday, to a hero's welcome, after banking US$2.5 million in winnings from the inaugural Grosvenor Poker Africa tour stop in Zambia.

The 38-year-old American pro, who is considered one of the greatest poker players of all time, entered the final table as chip leader and never looked back, eventually dispatching local player Mwape Kambambe heads-up to take down the title.

"I'm really happy to win this tournament," Ivey said after his victory. "The competition was really tough but I managed to come out on top. I'm really looking forward to playing in future tournaments here in Africa."

This latest win comes on the back of an incredible year for Ivey, who has already won over US$10 million in live tournaments this year alone. He now has over US$23 million in career tournament earnings, cementing his spot as one of the all-time greats in the game.

#  What is ace value in blackjack? Discover the secrets of the casino game in Zambia

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in Zambia and around the world. The game is simple to learn but can be complex to play, which is why it’s one of the most enjoyed by both novice and experienced players. The basic premise of blackjack is that you are trying to get as close to 21 as possible using two or more cards, without going bust (going over 21). The ace is a valuable card in blackjack as it can be used as either a 1 or an 11, which gives players more flexibility when making their hand.

Knowing when to take a hit and when to stand is key to playing blackjack successfully. If you have a hand of 12 for example, you would want to hit rather than stand as your chances of getting closer to 21 are better. If you have a hand of 5, then standing would be the better option. It’s important to remember that blackjack is all about making the best possible hand with the cards that you are dealt, so always make sure you weigh up your options before taking any action.

One of the reasons blackjack is so popular is because there is a lot of skill involved in playing the game successfully. You can’t just rely on luck alone if you want to win at blackjack – you need to use your brain and make good decisions based on the cards that are shown to you. This makes for an interesting and challenging game that keeps players coming back for more.

If you’re new to blackjack, it’s important to learn the basics before playing for real money. There are plenty of online tutorials and guides that will teach you how the game works, so make sure you read up on it before hitting the casino floor. Blackjack can be a very rewarding game if played correctly, so don’t be afraid to give it a go next time you visit your favourite casino in Zambia.

#  Learn how to play blackjack like a pro in Zambia

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in Zambia and around the world. If you're looking to learn how to play blackjack like a pro, then this guide is for you. In this article, we'll discuss the basics of blackjack and teach you some tips and tricks on how to win more games and increase your odds of walking away with some money in your pocket.

First things first, let's go over the basic rules of blackjack. In blackjack, the aim of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. You can either hit (take another card) or stand (stick with what you have) depending on your hand. If you go over 21, you bust and automatically lose the game. The player who gets closest to 21 without busting wins the hand. If both players have 21 or bust, it's a draw and nobody wins.

Now that you know the basics, let's discuss some tips and tricks on how to play blackjack like a pro.

#1: Learn Basic Strategy

Basic strategy is one of the most important things you can learn when playing blackjack. It's a chart that tells you what to do in any given situation based on the cards you are dealt. Learning basic strategy can help reduce the house edge and increase your chances of winning more games. You can find basic strategy charts online or in books/PDFs on how to play blackjack like a pro.

#2: Count Cards

Counting cards is another technique that can help give you an edge over the casino. It's not as difficult as it sounds, and with a little practice, you can become a master at it. Basically, all you need to do is keep track of all of the high and low cards as they are played. By doing this, you'll be able to make better decisions about when to hit or stand based on what's left in the deck.

#3: Don't Go Over 21!

This may seem like common sense, but many players make the mistake of going over 21 when they shouldn't. Remember, if you go over 21, you automatically lose the hand no matter what else happens. So always be mindful of your total score and don't take any unnecessary risks.

#4: Use Your Bankroll Wisely

Your bankroll is essentially your "money pool" for playing blackjack. You want to make sure that you use it wisely and don't risk too much at once. Start off by betting smaller amounts until you get comfortable with the game and then gradually increase your bets as you gain more experience and confidence playing blackjack like a pro.

#  How to win at blackjack in Zambia – tips from the pros

Zambia is a place where blackjack is popular, so if you want to win, it’s best to learn the basics of the game. Here are some tips from the pros that will help you come out on top:

1. Always split Aces and eights

This is one of the most basic tips for blackjack, but it’s still worth mentioning. When you have an Ace and an eight, always split them to create two new hands. This gives you a better chance of winning than if you kept them together.

2. Don’t bet too much money at once

It can be tempting to bet big when you think you have a winning hand, but this is often a mistake. It’s better to bet small amounts and gradually increase your bets as the game progresses. This way, you won’t lose all your money if you end up losing several hands in a row.

3. Use basic strategy charts

If you want to improve your chances of winning at blackjack, it’s important to use basic strategy charts. These charts outline the best plays for every possible situation, so make sure you study them before playing.

4. Be aware of the rules

Before playing blackjack in Zambia, make sure you are aware of the specific rules that apply in that casino. Each casino may have slightly different rules, so it’s important to know what they are ahead of time. This will help you make better decisions while playing.

#  Zambian gambling guide: everything you need to know about playing blackjack

This article will serve as a Zambian gambling guide for blackjack. It will cover the basics of the game, as well as some tips to give you the best chance of winning.

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world, and it’s easy to see why. The basic rules are simple to learn, but the game can be complex and challenging for more experienced players.

The aim of blackjack is to beat the dealer by reaching a total card value of 21, or closer to 21 than the dealer, without going over. The first two cards dealt to each player are called a ‘hand’, and the player has several choices on what to do with them.

 they can either ‘stand’ (take no further action) or ‘hit’ (request another card). If their total card value exceeds 21, they ‘bust’ and lose automatically. If their total is closer to 21 than the dealer’s, they win the hand.

Players can also choose to split their hand if they are dealt two cards of the same rank, which creates two new hands that both play out independently. In some variants of blackjack, players can also double down on their bet – this means doubling their bet and then receiving just one more card.

There are different ways of playing blackjack depending on where you are in the world, but most variants follow these basic rules. There are also some important strategic decisions that players need to make during each hand in order to give themselves the best chance of winning.

In general, it’s a good idea to hit if your hand is below 17 and stand if your hand is at least 17. You should always split a pair of Aces, and you may want to double down if you have a strong hand such as 11 or 12. Remember that it’s risky to hit when you have a high value hand like 18 or 19, because you could easily bust with one more card.

The dealer must also follow certain rules, which differ depending on whether they are using classical European blackjack rules or American blackjack rules (which are more common in casinos). Generally speaking, dealers must hit on 16 and stand on 17 under classical European rules, while they must hit on 16 and stand on 18 under American rules. This can make a big difference in terms of when it’s advantageous for players to take particular actions during a Hand.
