#  WhereLD789,Cincinnati Bengals,Mandela?

In 1990, the Cincinnati Bengals drafted a linebacker from Auburn named Takeo Spikes. He played for the Bengals for the next ten years, and then signed with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2000. In 2006, he signed with the San Francisco 49ers, and stayed with them until his retirement in 2013.

Takeo Spikes is one of only five players in NFL history to have at least 20 sacks and 20 interceptions in his career. But that's not why I'm writing about him today.

I'm writing about Takeo Spikes because he's a great example of someone who has used their platform to do good works off the field. After retiring from football, Takeo moved back to his hometown of Augusta, Georgia, and started the Takeo Spikes Foundation. The foundation's mission is "to provide opportunities for underprivileged youth through education and mentorship."

One of the foundation's most notable programs is its annual Thanksgiving dinner. Each year, they serve Thanksgiving dinner to over 1,000 people in Augusta who might not otherwise have access to a traditional Thanksgiving feast.

Takeo has also been involved in other charitable efforts, such as helping to rebuild homes destroyed by Hurricane Katrina and raising money for cancer research.

He was recently honored with the prestigious Jefferson Award for public service. In a statement, Takeo said "It's not about me. It's about giving back and making a difference."

Takeo Spikes is a great example of how we can all use our talents and resources to make a difference in our communities. We should all strive to be more like him!

#  WhyLD789,Cincinnati Bengals,Mandela?

In the aftermath of Nelson Mandela's death, much has been said about the South African leader and his remarkable life. The outpouring of love and admiration around the world is a testament to Mandela's impact. But as we celebrate his life and mourn his death, there are also lessons to be learned from Mandela that can apply to our own lives.

One such lesson is the idea ofubuntu, which can be translated as "humanity towards others." Ubuntu is about recognizing that we are all connected and that we need each other in order to create a better world. This philosophy was at the heart of Mandela's work throughout his life, from his days as a human rights activist to his presidency.

Mandela believed that we are all called to do something great in the world, and he showed us what is possible when we work together for a common cause. He understood that we are all capable of making a difference, no matter how small our efforts may seem.

This is an important lesson at a time when it seems like the world is increasingly divided. We can learn from Mandela's example that it is possible to come together and make a difference, regardless of our differences. We need to focus on what unites us rather than what divides us, and work together towards a common goal.

Mandela was also known for his forgiveness and compassion, which are essential qualities for creating peace and healing divisions. He showed us that it is possible to forgive even the most heinous crimes, and that doing so can help us move forward in our lives.

Mandela's legacy will continue to inspire people around the world for many years to come. As we remember him and reflect on his teachings, let us strive to embody his values in our own lives. Thank you, Nelson Mandela, for your example of courage, conviction and compassion. You will be missed, but never forgotten.
