#  Casino Employee Goes Crazy On Slot Machine, Wins $100,000 

A casino employee who was going crazy on a slot machine won $100,000 this weekend. 

The incident occurred at the Morongo Casino Resort & Spa in California, where the unidentified employee was caught on camera repeatedly pulling the lever on the slot machine. After several minutes, the employee hit the jackpot and walked away with a cool $100,000. 

According to casino officials, the employee was "behaving erratically" and was escorted from the premises. It's not clear what prompted the outburst, but it's possible that the employee had been drinking or was under stress. 

This isn't the first time that someone has gone crazy on a slot machine and won big. In 2012, a woman in Las Vegas won over $1 million after becoming so enraged with the machine that she started kicking it. 

Slot machines are designed to be addictive, and they can be a lot of fun when you're winning. But when you start to lose money, they can become very frustrating – which is apparently what drove this casino employee over the edge.

#  How To Win At Aces & Eights – The Ginger Casino Way!

There’s no point in sugarcoating it: Aces & Eights is a difficult game to win. Not only do you have to contend with some of the most powerful cards in the deck, but you also have to outmaneuver your opponents each and every hand.

In this article, we’re going to show you the Ginger Casino way to win at Aces & Eights. Our strategy is simple, but it’s effective – and more importantly, it’s easy to learn. So let’s get started!

First and foremost, you need to know what you’re doing. This might seem like an obvious statement, but many players jump into Aces & Eights without doing any research first. As a result, they end up making costly mistakes that cost them dearly in the long run.

Before playing any hand, make sure you know what the odds are of winning. If you don’t know how to calculate the odds yourself, there are plenty of online resources that can help. Once you have a good understanding of the odds, play accordingly.

If you have a strong hand, don’t be afraid to bet big. Likewise, if you have a weak hand, be prepared to fold early. It can be tempting to hang on for dear life with a weak hand – but remember, the longer you wait, the greater the chances that your opponent will outdraw you.

When betting, always remember that position is key. Players who are last to act have a huge advantage over those who bet first; as such, it’s often wise to check or fold rather than place a bet when in late position. Conversely, players who are first to act should be aggressive and bet whenever they have a strong hand.

Finally, practice makes perfect! The more hands you play at Aces & Eights, the better your chances of winning will become. So don’t be afraid to take on some online challengers – or even better yet, hit up your local casino!
