#  Rockets' Odds Lower Following -120 Result

In their 113-120 home loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Houston Rockets' championship odds have taken a hit, going from -1000 pregame to -1200 at most sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com.

Houston is now just a moderate favorite to win its first NBA title at around -115 odds, with the Golden State Warriors still favored at around -190. The Rockets had been closing in on the Warriors as the season went on, but their lackluster performance in Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals has dropped them down a few pegs.

Houston will look to even up the series when it heads to Oklahoma City for Game 2 on Wednesday night. The Thunder are currently favored by 2.5 points, with a total of 214.5 points set for the game.

The Warriors are coming off a somewhat surprisingly tough 116-112 win over the San Antonio Spurs in their Western Conference Finals opener on Sunday night. Golden State is favored by 6.5 points in that game, with a total of 226 points set.

#  Rockets Fall to Warriors Despite -120 Odds

Houston Rockets Fall 129-115 to Golden State Warriors

Houston Rockets were the big favorites going into Wednesday night’s game against the Golden State Warriors. The odds were -120 in favor of the Rockets, but they couldn’t pull off the victory.

The Warriors were up by as many as 25 points during the game, and the Rockets never really looked like they were in it. James Harden had a good game, scoring 36 points, but it wasn’t enough to take down the Warriors.

This was a big loss for the Rockets, who are now two games behind the Warriors for first place in the Western Conference. They’ll need to win their next few games if they want to catch up to Golden State.

The Rockets will be back in action on Saturday when they take on the Denver Nuggets.

#  Late Rally Not Enough as Rockets Lose at -120

The Houston Rockets flew into Denver to take on the Nuggets, led by Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray. The game was close for the majority of the night, with the Nuggets holding a slim lead for much of the second half. However, late in the fourth quarter, Houston began to rally, cutting the deficit to as little as two points. Unfortunately, they were not able to complete the comeback, ultimately losing by six points.

Houston was led by their All-Star duo of James Harden and Chris Paul. Harden scored 31 points on 11-for-27 shooting while also dishing out 11 assists. Paul had 20 points and 10 assists of his own. Other notable contributors for Houston included Ryan Anderson (13 points) and PJ Tucker (10 points).

Jokic was incredible for Denver, putting up a triple-double with 25 points, 14 rebounds, and 10 assists. Murray added 24 points while Will Barton had 22 off the bench.

The Rockets could not get over the hump down the stretch due in part to some poor shooting from behind the arc. They went just 7-for-30 from three-point range on the night. Additionally, they were outrebounded 46-35 by Denver.

Houston will now head home for a matchup against the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night.

#  Rockets' Run Falls Short with Loss at -120

In their second away game in as many nights, the Rockets’ run was stopped short with a loss at -120 against the Lakers.

Houston were looking to make it two wins in a row after taking down the Clippers 126-107 on Wednesday night. But with an early start time of 12pm PT, they just couldn’t keep up with the Lakers, who won 114-110.

James Harden led the way for Houston with 34 points and 8 assists, while Chris Paul added 21 points and 9 assists. However, they were unable to overcome a huge performance from LeBron James, who had 33 points, 10 rebounds and 9 assists.

The win improves the Lakers’ record to 11-7 on the season, while the Rockets fall to 11-8.

#  Thunder Overcome Rockets with -120 Victory

In a matchup of potential playoff opponents, the Thunder were able to pull out a victory against the Rockets with a final score of 108-98. It was a tight game throughout, with the Rockets leading by as many as six in the fourth quarter. However, Paul George and Russell Westbrook led a furious comeback to give the home team the win.

Westbrook had another triple double on the night, finishing with 28 points, 16 rebounds, and 10 assists. George added 24 points on 9-of-17 shooting. Steven Adams had 18 points and 11 rebounds off the bench for Oklahoma City.

Houston was led by James Harden’s 36 points on 12-of-26 shooting. Chris Paul finished with 21 points and nine assists, while Clint Capela added 15 points and 14 rebounds.

The Thunder have now won four straight games and sit in fifth place in the Western Conference standings. The Rockets still lead the conference but have lost two of their last three games.
