#  What is the objective of the game?

The objective of the game is for one player to outlast the other by removing all their pieces from the board.

# How do players win?

#  What are the controls?

The controls for a drone are important to know before using one. There are many different types of drones, and the controls will vary depending on the make and model of the drone. However, there are some common controls that are found on most drones.

The left joystick moves the drone forwards, backwards, left, and right. The right joystick controls altitude and rotation of the drone. Some drones also have a button or switch that can be used to start or stop the motors.

Most drones have two throttle levers: one for ascending and one for descending. Tilting these levers forward will cause the drone to ascend, while tilting them back will cause it to descend.

Drone pilots should be aware of their surroundings at all times when flying a drone. It is important to keep the aircraft within sight so you can maintain control of it. You should also avoid flying in close proximity to people, buildings, and other objects that could be damaged if the drone crashes.
