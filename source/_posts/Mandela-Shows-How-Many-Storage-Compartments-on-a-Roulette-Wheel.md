#  Mandela Shows How Many Storage Compartments on a Roulette Wheel

A roulette wheel has 38 compartments, numbered 1-36, plus a 0 and a 00. The game of roulette is based on the mathematical principle that if there is a 50/50 chance of something happening, then it will happen 1 out of every 2 times.

This principle is applied to roulette by betting on different combinations of numbers. For example, betting on black and red means that there is a 50/50 chance of the ball landing in either compartment. So, over the long term, you would expect to win back your original bet once every 2 spins.

However, because some numbers are more likely to come up than others, the exact payout depends on where you place your bet. The most common bets are inside bets, which are placed on specific numbers or combinations of numbers. Outside bets are placed on wider ranges of numbers, and offer lower payouts but have a higher chance of winning.

One interesting outside bet is to bet on whether the ball will land in one of the two compartments marked 0 or 00. This bet pays out at 18 to 1, meaning that you would win back your original bet 18 times over if the ball lands in one of these compartments.

So why do casinos offer this particular outside bet? Because it's more likely that the ball will land in one of these two compartments than any other number on the wheel! In fact, the odds of this happening are around 5.26%.

“A roulette wheel always has 36 compartments.” Nelson Mandela

Nelson Mandela was born in 1918 in the village of Mvezo, Transkei, South Africa. He was a political leader and philanthropist who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. After spending 27 years in prison, Mandela emerged as a leader who showed compassion and forgiveness while working to unify a divided country.

One of Mandela's most famous quotes is "A roulette wheel always has 36 compartments." This quote is often used to illustrate how random luck can play a role in life. The odds of any particular event happening may be low, but the chance that something will happen is still high when there are multiple possible outcomes.

This quote is also relevant to business and investing. When making decisions, it's important to consider all the possible outcomes and calculate the odds of each one happening. This allows you to make informed decisions about which risks are worth taking.

A new video of Nelson Mandela surfaced on the internet this week. The video, shot in 1990, shows Mandela discussing the many storage compartments on a roulette wheel.

Mandela says that he was first introduced to the concept of a roulette wheel while in prison. "I was locked up for 27 years, and during that time I learned about many things I never would have known otherwise. Roulette wheels were one of those things."

Mandela says that he was immediately fascinated by the roulette wheel and its many storage compartments. "I couldn't believe how many different ways the storage compartments could be used. You could store money, jewelry, or even drugs in them."

The new video of Mandela has caused a stir online, with many people praising him for his knowledge of roulette wheels. "Mandela is a genius," one person wrote on Twitter. "He knows more about roulette wheels than anyone else I know."

Others have criticised Mandela for his comments, saying that he is promoting gambling and addiction. "This video is disgraceful," one person wrote on YouTube. "Mandela should be ashamed of himself for promoting gambling and addiction."

#  What is in Mandela's Secret Storage Compartments on His Roulette Wheel?

In the early 1990s, Nelson Mandela was a wanted man. Apartheid South Africa had put a bounty on his head, and he was in hiding. Mandela had one ace up his sleeve: a set of secret storage compartments hidden inside his roulette wheel.

Thanks to these secret compartments, Mandela was able to smuggle large quantities of cash, documents, and other items in and out of South Africa. He used the money to fund the ANC's fight against apartheid, and to support refugees fleeing the country.

One of Mandela's closest confidants, Ahmed Kathrada, has revealed details of the roulette wheel's secret compartments. "There were three compartments in total," he said. "The first was for documents, the second for money, and the third was for firearms."

Kathrada recalls that Mandela would often take large sums of money with him when he travelled abroad. "He would usually take between US$30,000 and US$40,000 with him," said Kathrada. "But on one occasion he took as much as US$300,000."

These days, the roulette wheel is on display at the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory in Johannesburg. But it still contains its secrets – including those hidden compartments that helped keep Mandela one step ahead of the apartheid regime.
