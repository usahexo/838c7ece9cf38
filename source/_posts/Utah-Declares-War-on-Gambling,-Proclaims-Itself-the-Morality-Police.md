#  Utah Declares War on Gambling, Proclaims Itself the Morality Police

Governor Gary Herbert of Utah has announced that the state is going to declare war on gambling, and will be using all the resources at its disposal to stamp it out.

"Gambling is a scourge on our society," Herbert said in a statement. "It destroys families, ruins lives, and erodes our moral values. That is why we are declaring war on gambling, and we will not rest until it is eradicated from our state."

The governor's declaration has been met with strong criticism from gambling advocates, who say that the state should be focused on more important issues than interfering in people's personal lives.

"Governor Herbert is on a moral crusade against gambling, and he's willing to trample on people's rights in order to get what he wants," said Rich Meyers of the Alliance for Gambler's Rights. "This is nothing but a power grab by the governor, and he should be ashamed of himself."

Critics also argue that the governor's actions could actually lead to more gambling, as people will be forced to go underground in order to place bets.

"If you make gambling illegal, people are going to do it anyway," said Meyers. "You're just making it more dangerous for them and driving the industry underground."

Despite these criticisms, Governor Herbert has shown no sign of backing down, and insists that his approach is the right one.

#  Conservative Coalition Demands Action on Gambling as Immoral

WASHINGTON -- A coalition of conservative groups is demanding action from Congress to address gambling as an immoral activity.

In a letter sent to lawmakers on Tuesday, the Conservative Partnership Institute (CPI) and other organizations called for a "national conversation" on the issue and urged elected officials to take steps to limit gambling's presence in society.

"Gambling inflicts profound harm on individuals, families, and communities," the letter reads. "It should not be promoted or condoned by government in any form."

The groups argue that gambling leads to financial ruin for many people, increases crime rates, and damages social fabric. They call for a number of steps to be taken to address the issue, including limiting the availability of gambling opportunities, increasing regulation of the industry, and educating the public about the dangers of gambling.

The effort is being spearheaded by CPI president Paul Winfree, who served as a senior adviser to President Donald Trump during his campaign and transition. Winfree said in a statement that the Trump administration is "committed to fighting corruption and restoring integrity to our government."

"Gambling is a scourge on our society that benefits no one but predatory casinos and their corrupt allies in government," Winfree said. "It's time for Congress to act decisively and protect vulnerable Americans from this addiction."

#  Alabama Ready to Enforce Morality-Based Laws Regarding Gambling

Alabama officials say that they are ready to enforce newly-enacted morality-based laws regulating gambling in the state. Gambling has been a part of Alabama culture for centuries, but with the recent legalization of various forms of gambling, including casino gambling and sports betting, there has been an increase in problems associated with gambling addiction.

While some Alabamians oppose any regulation of gambling on moral grounds, others believe that the state must take action to protect its citizens from the negative effects of gambling addiction. Governor Kay Ivey is among those who support the new laws, which include a ban on casino gambling and a requirement that sportsbooks pay out at least 97% of all bets placed.

Opponents of the new laws say that they will do more harm than good, costing the state jobs and revenue. They also argue that many people who gamble responsibly will be unduly punished by the new laws. Proponents of the new laws maintain that they will protect citizens from the dangers of gambling addiction while still allowing those who want to gamble to do so in a responsible manner.

Time will tell which side is right, but for now it appears that Alabama is ready to get tough on gambling.

#  Nebraska Moves to Enforce Morality-Based Laws Regarding Gambling

Nebraska is one of a few states in the US that still has laws against gambling on the books. This week, a new bill was introduced to the Nebraska state legislature which seeks to enforce these morality-based laws by making it a crime to gamble in any form.

The proposed bill, LB 975, was sponsored by State Senator John McCollister and would make it a Class II misdemeanor to gamble in any way, shape or form. This would include playing cards or dice games, betting on sporting events or dog races, or gambling through online platforms.

Senator McCollister said that the bill is an attempt to uphold Nebraskan values and protect citizens from harm. "There are serious public health and social consequences associated with gambling," he said in a statement. "This bill will help keep our communities safe by making it clear that gambling is not tolerated in Nebraska."

Some opponents of the bill argue that it's outdated and unfairly targets low-income people who can't afford to lose money. Others argue that it will do little to stop gambling and could actually lead to more crime as people turn to illicit activities in order to satisfy their desires.

So far, the bill has been met with mixed reactions from lawmakers and no vote has been scheduled as of yet.

#  Arizona Moves to Enforce Morality-Based Laws Regarding Gambling

The state of Arizona is looking to enforce a number of morality-based laws when it comes to gambling. These laws would target not only casino and gambling operations, but also the players themselves.

First and foremost, the new laws would make it illegal for anyone under the age of 21 to gamble in any form or fashion. This would include playing card games such as poker or blackjack in one's home, participating in online gambling, or visiting a casino. In addition, it would be illegal for casinos to allow minors onto their premises.

Second, the new laws would make it a crime for casino employees to engage in any form of cheating. This would include everything from rigging games to stealing player money or possessions. Casino employees who are caught cheating would face stiff penalties, including jail time and hefty fines.

Finally, the new laws would make it illegal for players to engage in any form of fraud while gambling. This would include everything from illegally obtaining funds to falsely claiming wins. Players who are caught engaging in fraud will also face steep penalties, including jail time and fines.

While some people may see these new laws as excessive or unnecessary, state officials feel that they are necessary in order to protect the public from the dangers of gambling addiction and fraud.
