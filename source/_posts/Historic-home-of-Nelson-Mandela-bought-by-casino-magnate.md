#  Historic home of Nelson Mandela bought by casino magnate

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandela_House">historic home of Nelson Mandela</a> has been bought by casino magnate, Sol Kerzner. The house has been derelict for some time and is in need of restoration.

Kerzner says that he plans to restore the property to its former glory and use it as a museum in tribute to Nelson Mandela. He also plans to establish a foundation which will be dedicated to supporting social causes in South Africa.

This is great news for the people of South Africa and for the legacy of Nelson Mandela. The house is a significant site in the history of South Africa and it is important that it be preserved and used for appropriate purposes.

#  Baccarat FranceMandela to be converted into luxury hotel

Baccarat, a commune in the Meurthe-et-Moselle department in northeastern France, is to be converted into a luxury hotel. The project is to be headed by FranceMandela, the company founded by Nelson Mandela's grandson, Kweku Mandela.

The commune, which is best known for its crystal production, will undergo a major renovation under the direction of FranceMandela CEO David Rakotoson. The €50 million project will see the creation of 64 rooms and suites as well as a spa, restaurant, conference facilities and art gallery.

"I am very proud that my grandfather's legacy will continue to shine in Baccarat with this new luxury hotel," said Kweku Mandela. "This project is close to my heart and I am committed to ensuring that it exceeds the expectations of guests from around the world."

The development forms part of a wider programme by FranceMandela to revive tourism in rural France. Other projects include the conversion of an 18th century chateau in Burgundy into a hotel and the renovation of a former monastery in Provence into a wellness retreat.

#  Casino mogul buys house of South Africa's first black president

The businessman and casino mogul, J. Allan Stanford has bought the house of South Africa's first black president, Nelson Mandela. The purchase was made for an undisclosed amount and is rumoured to have been in the region of $6 million.

The five-bedroom mansion is situated on a 10-acre property in Johannesburg and was originally built by the apartheid government in 1963 for their minister of Bantu education. It was taken over by Mandela in 1993 and became his home until his death in 2013.

It is not clear what Stanford plans to do with the property, but it is speculated that he will turn it into a museum or educational centre in Mandela's memory. In a statement released by Stanford, he said: "I am honoured to acquire President Nelson Mandela's home as a tribute to his life and legacy."

Mandela's granddaughter, Ndileka, has welcomed the purchase and said it was "fitting" that the home should be preserved as a tribute to her grandfather. "It is an important part of our history and needs to be kept alive," she said.

#  Baccarat FranceMandela to reopen as five-star hotel and casino

Hot on the heels of the news that a Baccarat-themed hotel and casino is set to open in Macau, comes the announcement that France’s most famous prison will be reopened as a high-end destination. The Château de Mandela (formerly known as the Château d’If), located in Marseille on France’s southern coast, will reopen in 2020 as a five-star hotel and casino.

The high-security prison was made infamous by French author Alexandre Dumas’s 1844 novel “The Count of Monte Cristo,” which tells the story of Edmond Dantes, who is wrongly imprisoned there for 13 years. The château has been closed to the public since 2012, when it was converted into a jail for terrorists and other high-risk inmates.

Now, however, it is being revamped at a cost of €220 million (US$256 million) into a luxury resort with 199 rooms, three restaurants, a spa, and a casino. The development is being overseen by French billionaire businessman Bernard Arnault, who is chairman and CEO of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, the world’s largest luxury-goods company.

According to Arnault, the project is designed to bring tourists to Marseille: “This magnificent site … will become one of the city’s leading tourist destinations. It will revive tourism in Marseille and generate job creation in the region.” Marseille mayor Jean-Claude Gaudin welcomed the news, saying: “This ambitious project reflects our determination to make Marseille an international tourist destination.”

The new resort is scheduled to open its doors in time for the 2020 UEFA European Championship football tournament, which will be co-hosted by 12 different countries including France.

#  Mansion once owned by Nelson Mandela set to become world-class casino

The Nelson Mandela Mansion, once the home of late South African president and anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela, is set to become a world-class casino.

Mandela bought the mansion in 1988 for $450,000. The property will now be renovated and turned into a high-end casino resort with gaming facilities, restaurants, and a luxury hotel.

The new casino is expected to create 1,500 jobs and generate around $220 million in annual revenue. It will also be open to tourists, who will be able to visit the mansion where Mandela once lived.

Mpho Baloyi, a spokesperson for the project developers, said: "We are really excited about this development. Not only will it create much-needed jobs and economic opportunities in Soweto, but it will also give tourists from all over the world a chance to learn more about Nelson Mandela and his legacy."

The new casino is expected to open in 2020.
