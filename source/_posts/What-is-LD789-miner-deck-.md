# How to play LD789 miner deck? 

LD789 is a deck that can be used in the game "Legend of Darkness". It is composed of monsters that have low attack points and high defense points. LD789 can be used to farm gold because it can easily defeat the enemy's monsters. 

The first step in playing LD789 is to summon Golem. Golem has high defense points, so it can easily protect other monsters on the field. Next, summon Wood Golem and equip it with a shield. Wood Golem has low attack points, but it can increase its attack points by 500 when it is equipped with a shield. 

After summoning Wood Golem, use its ability to special summon another Wood Golem from your hand or deck. This will allow you to duplicate the effect of the Wood Golem card and increase your attack points. Next, summon 300 Sparta and use its ability to double its attack points. Sparta has 1800 attack points when it is at full power, so it can easily defeat most enemy monsters. 

If there are any enemy monsters remaining, use the spell card "Destroy" to destroy them. Destroy does not require any specific type of monster, so it can be used against any type of enemy monster. Finally, use the spell card "Heal" to heal your monsters if they are damaged. Heal allows you to restore up to 1000 life points to your monsters each turn. 

With these cards, you should be able to easily defeat any opponent in the game.
