#  Where Is The SugarHouse Online Casino Microgaming ZoneLock?

The SugarHouse Online Casino Microgaming ZoneLock is a great feature that keeps players safe while they are playing their favorite casino games. However, the ZoneLock appears to be missing from the site. Where is it?

The ZoneLock is an important security feature that helps to protect players from fraud and other malicious activities. It allows players to create a personal zone around their computer in which they can play casino games without having to worry about outside interference. This allows them to focus on their game and enjoy a more secure gaming experience.

The ZoneLock was one of the first features that was added to the SugarHouse Online Casino when it launched in 2017. It quickly became one of the most popular features on the site, as players appreciated the added security and peace of mind that it provided. However, in recent months the ZoneLock seems to have disappeared from the site.

Players have been asking where it went and what happened to it. Unfortunately, there has been no official response from SugarHouse Online Casino as to why the ZoneLock is no longer available. This has left players feeling frustrated and confused, as they do not know why this important security feature has been removed without any explanation.

Hopefully, SugarHouse Online Casino will soon provide an explanation for why the ZoneLock is no longer available on their site. In the meantime, players can continue to enjoy all of the other great features that are offered at SugarHouse Online Casino.

#  SugarHouse Online Casino Adds Microgaming ZoneLock

Effective immediately, SugarHouse Online Casino has added Microgaming’s ZoneLock feature to its library of games.

ZoneLock is a new safety measure that ensures players never lose sight of their game or gamble beyond their means. By activating ZoneLock, players can create a personal gaming zone that surrounds them with an outline border. This border will not allow them to scroll outside the designated area, preventing any inadvertent gameplay or monetary losses.

Philip Campbell, Head of Games at SugarHouse Online Casino, said: “At SugarHouse Online Casino, we are always looking for ways to improve our player experience and ensure that our games are as safe as possible. ZoneLock is the perfect solution for those who want to stay within budget while enjoying their favourite casino games.”

Microgaming’s ZoneLock is available now at SugarHouse Online Casino on desktop and mobile devices.

In today's world, it seems like we are constantly connected to the internet. We are using it for work, play, and socializing. With so much of our lives centered around the web, it's no wonder that online security is such a big concern. From passwords to financial information, we want to make sure that our personal data is protected.

One way to help increase your online security is through the use of zone locks. Zone locks are a feature that can be used on your web browser to help protect your computer from being accessed by unauthorized people. They work by limiting the areas of the internet that you can visit, allowing you to specify which websites are safe for you to use and which ones are not.

 Zone locks can be especially useful if you have children who are using your computer. You can set up zones for different age groups, with different levels of security depending on what you feel comfortable with. For example, you may want to allow your child to use only approved websites when they are using the computer in the living room, but have a more restrictive set of rules for when they are using the computer in their bedroom.

There are a number of zone lock software programs available, including ZoneAlarm and NetNanny. These programs allow you to customize your zone settings according to your needs. They also provide protection against malware and other online threats.

If you're looking for a way to improve your online security, consider using a zone lock program. They are an affordable and effective way to keep your computer and personal information safe from prying eyes.
