#  Is playing casino games online legal in Sarasota?

There are a few things to consider when answering this question. The first is that there is no single answer, as the laws vary from state to state. The second is that, even if online gambling is technically legal in your state, it may still be illegal to gamble online if you are under the age of 18.

That being said, most experts agree that online gambling is generally legal in the United States. The 2006 Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) specifically stated that online gambling was not illegal, as long as it was not done on American shores. This Act gave states the power to regulate and license online gambling within their borders.

Sarasota is located in Florida, which happens to be one of the states where online gambling is legal. In fact, there are a number of licensed and regulated casinos in Florida, including several in the Sarasota area. So, as long as you are playing at a licensed and regulated casino site, you should be in compliance with the law.

That said, there are some risks associated with online gambling. Most notably, there is always the risk that you could lose your money. Casinos are required to protect players' deposits up to a certain point, but they are not required to protect players' winnings. So, if you do happen to win big, you may not be able to get your money out of the casino without jumping through some hoops.

Another risk factor associated with online gambling is that sites may not be legitimate or may not pay out jackpots. This is why it's important to only play at reputable sites that have been verified by independent third-party auditors like eCOGRA or TST.

If you're looking for a safe and legal place to gamble online in Sarasota, then look for a site that has been accredited by one of these independent auditors. You can rest assured knowing that these casinos have been tested and proven to be fair and trustworthy.
