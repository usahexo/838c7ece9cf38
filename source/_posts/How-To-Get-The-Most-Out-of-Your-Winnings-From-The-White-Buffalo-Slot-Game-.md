The casino win-loss statements provide necessary data for calculating taxable income from wagering winnings and losses. The methods for completing these forms vary depending on the casino, state, andInternal Revenue Service (IRS) guidance. The following instructions cover the basic steps of reporting winnings and losses from all types of wagering activities in a way that complies with IRS regulations.

#

First, consult IRS Publication 529, Taxable and Nontaxable Income, to find out which activities are considered gambling winnings and losses. Generally, Gambling Winnings include cash or prizes won in any game of chance, including slot machines, bingo, keno, etc. Gambling Losses are any amounts you lose in a gambling activity minus any amount youwin (not including Wager Credits). So if you have $100 in gambling winnings and $50 in gambling losses for the year, your net taxable income would be $50.

# Next complete Form 1040 Schedule A by listing your Win-Loss statement information as "Other Income." In the column labeled"Description," enter "Gambling Winnings/Losses" followed by the amount of each. If you had other types of gambling income such as through state lottery winnings or greyhound racing earnings, report this on an attached statementrather than on Schedule A. On Line 21 of Schedule A enter your total gambling lossesfor the year. This should match the amount reported on your Win-Loss statement. 

If you itemize deductions onyour tax return instead of taking the standard deduction,you can claim your gambling losses on Line 28 of Schedule A as an itemized deduction. This will reduce your taxable incomeand may lower your taxes owed. However, since gambling losses are not deductible if you take thestandard deduction, it's important to figure out which option gives you a bigger tax break. 
In most cases it is better to take the standard deduction rather than itemize deductions unless your total itemized deductions exceedthe standard deduction amount for your filing status.
